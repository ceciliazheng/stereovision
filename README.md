## camera calibration
I. perform single camera calibration
1. Move the pattern everywhere in the calibration volume.
2. Take pictures of the pattern in every possible position.
3. Angle the pattern with respect to the focal axis and move the inclined pattern all over the calibration volume.
4. Uniformly distribute the measurements in the calibration volume.
5. Empirically, around 50 images would give a good calibration result.

II. perform stereo camera calibration  
This step should be performed after performing camera calibration for each camera individually.
